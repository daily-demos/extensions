# Contributing

Thank you for looking into contributing to `extensions`! We hope that as people build things with Daily, they'll be willing to share interesting ideas with others. We especially welcome extensions that connect services we may not be familiar with yet. You often know how to use those APIs better than we do!

**Before contributing:**

- [Read our code of conduct](#read-our-code-of-conduct)

**How to contribute:**

- [Open or claim an issue](#open-or-claim-an-issue)

## How to contribute

### Open or claim an issue

#### Open an issue

Today we work from two main issue templates: _bug reports_ and _extension requests_.

_Bug reports_

Issues in this repo are for bugs specific to a Daily Extension, not a Daily call or Prebuilt itself. If you want to report a bug you experienced while on a Daily call, try out these [troubleshooting tips](https://help.daily.co/en/articles/2303117-top-troubleshooting-tips) to see if that takes care of the bug, or visit [daily.co](https://daily.co) to contact Daily support directly.

Likewise, you may need to check with a third-party service provider if you're having problems with an extension.

If you're still having a problem, check to see if somebody else has [already filed the issue](https://github.com/daily-demos/extensions/issues) before creating a new one.

If you've done those two things and need to create an issue, we'll ask you to tell us:

- What you expected to happen
- What actually happened
- Steps to reproduce the error
- Screenshots that illustrate where and what we should be looking for when we reproduce
- System information, like your device, OS, and browser
- Any additional context that you think could help us work through this

_extension requests_

We're always happy to hear about new ways you'd like to use an extension, or ideas for a new extension you'd find useful. We'll ask you to let us know:

- What problem the extension will help you solve
- Alternative solutions you've considered
- Any additional context that might help us understand this request

#### Claim an issue

Extensions are open-source by design; they're all up for grabs! If you'd like to tackle an existing issue, feel free to assign yourself, and please leave a comment letting everyone know that you're on it.

### Open a pull request

- If it's been a minute or if you haven't yet cloned, forked, or branched a repository, GitHub has some [docs to help](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests).
- When creating commit messages and pull request titles, please follow the [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) standard.

### Contribute a new extension

If you've built a Daily Extension that you want to share with other developers, we'd be more than happy to help spread the word! Feel free to open a PR here, and a member of the Daily team will work with you to get it merged.
